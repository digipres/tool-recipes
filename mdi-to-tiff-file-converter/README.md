# MDI to TIFF File Converter

## Overview
MDI is a proprietary file format of MODI (Microsoft Office Document Imaging), which was deprecated as part of Office 2010. This conversion tool will allow you to view MDI files after they are converted to TIFF. TIFF files may be viewed using a variety of image viewing programs, such as the Windows Fax and Image Viewer.

## Builder

This builder uses a Windows Docker container to run the tool, because it does not seem to be compatible with WINE.  When running with WINE, issues like the ones below are logged, and the file write operation fails.

```
0024:fixme:enhmetafile:PlayEnhMetaFileRecord type 119 is unimplemented
0024:fixme:enhmetafile:PlayEnhMetaFileRecord EMR_EXTCREATEPEN: Need to copy brush bitmap
0024:fixme:enhmetafile:PlayEnhMetaFileRecord Unknown imode 4
```

Using Windows involves [switching modes in Docker Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce#windows-10-and-windows-11-2) and running from e.g. PowerShell not WSL2.  But this means `make` is not present, which complicated things.

```
> docker build -t mdi2tif .
