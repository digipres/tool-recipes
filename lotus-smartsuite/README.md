Lotus SmartSuite
================

## Outline
Here's the idea... Can we make it easy to play with `.sam` Ami Pro files?

Run this `Makefile`!, it should... (NOT COMPLETE):

- Download the ISO/other stuff if it can, 
- Check what should exists actually does, 
- Run the image builder,
- Check the results work!

You now have your own thing you can run!
