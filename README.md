Tool Builder
============

A highly experimental 'tool registry' that stores information about tools (compatible with COPTR) but also recipes to make it easier to assemble and run the tools in appropriate environments.

Depends on access to a suitable container environment and hardware resources.

This is a very rough proof-of-concept to see if there is interest in this idea. Doing this 'properly' would be a lot of work and need a lot of resources.  But at least we might work out what doing this 'properly' might mean!
